This package makes it easy to send notifications using [Jabber](link to service) with Laravel 5.7.

**Tip:** Use "Find in Path/Files" in your code editor to find these keywords within the package directory and replace all occurences with your specified term.

This is where your description should go. Add a little code example so build can understand real quick how the package can be used. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.
